    # 근처에 should also work, different meaning
    # As is, 근처 is a noun and 가까이 is an adverb used only in conjunction with other stuff.
    # However, if you add the particle 에 after 가까이, it becomes synonymous with 근처(에) essentially.
    # 근처 is more like the vicinity around the speaker and 가까이에 is "close" (distance between two objects).
    # Think of 가까이 as a string between two objects a short distance apart, whereas 근처에 is a circle radiating a short distance around a central object.
